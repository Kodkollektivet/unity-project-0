# Unity project 0: goals and tasks

### Documenting
Rod, Alex, ... !!!LIST YOURSELF HERE IF EDITING!!! Davvveeee

### Game outline

- Pseudo-2D == 3D
- Platformer
- Striking, vibrant artstyle coupled with simplistic player, enemy or / and interactive object design

### Gameplay

- Simple puzzles (thing preventing you from going somewhere) i.e. problem solving
- Collection of items
- Unlock new character moves during gameplay progression
- Explore old areas with new abilities
- Gradual development (i.e. larva -> lovecraftian thing)
- See more of the game as character grows:
    - backgrounds
    - enemies
    - objects
    - altitude
- Funny descriptions of objects in the environment
    - change as character evolves
        - i.e. tree -> "dangerous organism?"
        - parent blob -> "stepmother"

### Working with unity
- Research and make use of built-in elements
- Free assets:
    - use
    - modify
- Be very object-oriented
- Otherwise we will kill you

### Other software
- 2D design
    - Sketchbook
    - Gimp
    - Procreate
- For 3D modeling
    - Blender
    - whatever else works

### Game suggestions for inspiration
- Hollow Knight (similar platformer idea)
- Zelda series (world exploration)
- Badland
- Spore
- Ori

### Project components:
- Test environment:
    - separate branch containing all assets, scripts, etc
    - testing new features
    - testing interactions between things

- "Product" env:
    - Separate branch for the WIP game with all tested content

- Story
    - World
        - start underground?
            - the hollow of a tree root, start of the game is driven by necessity, a predator tries to eat the character, escaping and killing it is a priority? Learn an ability from evading the early enemy
        - growth of wings idea: the feathers get stolen and burst out then later after you have lost the ones that burst through, eventually devEloping its own better version.
    - Species
        - Rabbit!
        - Toad or Frog,
        -  Wood Lice, centipedes, Other small bug like creatures like PeeWee or PeeWees head on a centipede.
    - Character
    - Storyline
        - the environments dictate the challenges and predators nacht!
    - Storytelling:
        - show rather than tell
        - show less than you know
        - leave room for imagination

### "Teams":
- Story
- 2d
- 3d
- Code
- Level design
- Sound
- Animation?

### Goal breakdown:
- Menues 
- Saves
- Levels
- Worldmap
- Controls
    - Differ depending on current player form

### Next Actions
- set up a basic enviroNment in the Unity
    - move the character
    - fix the camera view
        - could be a central zone, you can move within 60% of the central region but if you go to an edge zone then the level view moves in that direction.
