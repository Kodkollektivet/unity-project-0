# unity-project-0
So we wanted to try and make a platformer..

## Rules
1. Work in branch 'dev'
2. Merge with 'main' only when a stage of the project is complete
3. Merge without removing source branch
4. Pull before pushing
5. Create and work in your separate branch if making modifications to something that already exists and works

### Code structure / style
1. Use // comment notation
2. Tab size == 4
3. OOP
4. Avoid static
5. Keep class names PascalCase
6. camelCase for methods and properties
7. Names should be informative; i.e., i, j, etc. are only acceptable in iterators
