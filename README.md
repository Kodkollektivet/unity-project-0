## Chelsea's initial understanding of the story:
Blob falls from mother-gum, tries to go back. Evolves into eldritch horror that Alex thinks is cute. 
And ?
Ending ideas
1.	Finds way back to mummy-gum.
2.	Destroys mummy-gum.
3.	Become new mother MG
4.	Becomes universe seed.
I think the narrative thread should follow a quest/Adventure plot line as they search for mother-gum with elements of metamorphosis as they ‘absorb’ / learn different skills and abilities. 
A fever dream idea. 
MG could be some kind of hive mind creature that travels between different planets or realms possibly as some kind of cancer that lies in wait and destroys these worlds from the inside. Little Blobby gets distracted by some shiny creature and detaches from MG to investigate and is left behind as MG moves on to the next. Blobby is unaware that MG is ‘destroying’ from their perspective MG could be cleansing the realm or feeding it’s hive mind so Blobby doesn’t question whether MG is bad or good all Blobby knows is that MG is mummy and tries to go back.
Blobby is connected to MG on ‘spiritual’ level and can follow the trail from place to place trying to get back. Blobby starts their quest and gains some abilities on the way believing that they are growing more powerful to get to MG quicker and to stay alive. Blobby becomes friends with a tiny helpless creature (Piwi) that is also lost and trying to get back to home and Blobby helps.  As they interact Piwi tells Blobby about an awful creature that came into their world and destroyed everything, so they are in search of some family that live far away. 
They get to the family sanctuary; it has been rent asunder no survivors and Blobby recognizes MG’s trail in the ruins. Blobby slowly realizes that MG is evil and reflects on how much they’ve grown into creature similar to MG and their quest turns into one of vengeance as MG has to be stopped before destroying more worlds. At this point we can lean heavily on moral mechanics, for example absorbing more (technically innocent, defenseless, homeless) creatures to become stronger to defeat MG or not and more pressure with bosses. 
Final fight with MG, lose and be reabsorbed, win and destroy MG and become universe seed.	
Some more tidbits to add:

1.	Easter eggs
2.	Artifacts
3.	Other Blobs that escaped MG
4.	More MG survivors
5.	Untouched pockets in destroyed realms.

## 26/04/2023. Brain storm during meeting
Vague about MG’s actions in the beginning.
MG sends out her blobs like spores (doesn't expect all to return, sort of a survival of the fittest situation)
Doomsday cult that worships MG and awaits her return, get obsessed with Blobby. Blobby has to decide if it should relish the worship or fight the cult

## How do we fit corn boy in the story?? It's important to Dave.

## ACT structure
I find creatures, make friends
II  Understand it's origins
III  Make decisions about how to end it all 


## 03/05/2023 level 1 Brainstorm

Dave christened Blobby as 'Ed' short for 'Eddy' which is short for 'Edwards'. #We_Support_WorkPlace_Bullying.

Ed can scavenge, hunt or befriend.
1. Scavenger: slower level up, lowest risk for food obtaining, least reward, makes Ed more like MG, increases stealth and allows Ed to learn by Observing. But because scavenging is creepy AF friendly creatures are less likely to interact.
2. Hunter: Faster level up, friendly creatures less likely to engage, will attract more hostile creatures to it, learn by doing, more complex features but fewer 'slots'.
3. Befriender: more likely to encounter friendly creatures, Ed can learn by training with friendlys gains weaker but more 'slots' for features.

For leveling up we can have the player decide which features they want to gain as they evolve

## Swampy Zone: Level 1/5? (Tutorial level)
This level unlocks a tail from the remains from scavenging, tail slap technique from friends, some sort of bone structure from fighting final boss for hunting.

Level surrounded by shallow waters,
